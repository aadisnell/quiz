          <h2>Brief overview about us & what we do </h2>
          <p>We are a business organization in Ghana, located in Accra. We deal with the compiling of statistics in the various seasons and tournaments in football since the beginning of the sport into multiple choice questions. Questions can be on anything in the game since its beginning. We want to give soccer fans the opportunity to make some money from their knowledge in the game they love by answering one multiple choice question in 15 seconds. If the subscriber answers the question correctly, the organization will pay to the subscriber three-times the money used to participate in the quiz. Payment to the winners will be made in three different periods in a day. Early morning payment: 8:00am, Afternoon payment: 1:00pm and Evening payment: 7:00pm. So a winner will receive his money depending on the interval within which he/she won.</p>
          <p> We have questions for different categories. The categories so far are: The English Premier League, The Spanish La Liga, The UEFA Champions League, The FIFA World cup and The African Cup of Nations. So a subscriber has the option to choose the category he/she wants to answer the question from. Steps to expand these categories are currently on-going. So that there will be more options to choose from as and when you are ready to play. For comments or complaints you can visit our feedback section and get in touch with us.</p>

      <p>Prince Derrick Mintah Cauchy, Founder and CEO of Smart Soccer Quiz, graduated from the University of Ghana in the year 2018 after reading BSc Mathematics and Statistics during the four years period. He is a rabid fan of football, and has been following the game since his childhood days. He came up with the idea of Smart Soccer Quiz to give football fans the opportunity to make some money out of the knowledge they have on the beautiful game. Prince Cauchy, as he is usually called, is also a young motivational speaker who seeks to help his colleagues realize their dreams and aspirations. His favorite quote comes from Napoleon Hill’s “THINK AND GROW RICH” which says “you have absolute control over only one thing, which is ‘your thought’. And it is the sole means by which you may control your own destiny”.</p>
